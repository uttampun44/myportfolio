                         <p>Is CRA (Create React App) dead? Most developers are asking.
                            The truth is that CRA is not dead; it still exists.
                            It is easy for beginners who want to learn, react, upgrade their javascript skills, and learn new tools.
                             But there are a few things that make Vite more better than CRA.Â </p>
                          <p>I want to highlight the points. It's my opinion because I have worked with both tools.</p>

                                <li>1) CRA is laggy when we install it. It takes a lot of time.</li>
                                <li>2) It is not good for optimization.</li>
                                <li>3) For big projects, it is not recommended now.</li>
                                <li>4) Also, it does not support Webpack, Bundler, etc.</li>
